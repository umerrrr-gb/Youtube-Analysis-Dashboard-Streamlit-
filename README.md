# Youtube-Analysis-Dashboard-Streamlit-

A **Streamlit dashboard** to visualize YouTube channel and video metrics. Track your channel's subscribers, total views, video trends over the years, and more — all in one interactive dashboard!  

This project uses **YouTube Data API** (via Colab) to fetch the data and then displays it with **Streamlit**, **pandas**, and **matplotlib**.
